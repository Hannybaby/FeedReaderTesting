## How to use
 This is a feed reader testing project where we test the Udacity feed reader application using the testing framework "Jasmine". We test e. g. that the feed reader menu is working fine or that URLs are defined. For more information what we test see comments in [feedreader.js](jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) file.  

 Use [feedreader.js](jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) as well to change the tests and write new ones. 

 Click on [index.html](index.html) to see the HTML code as well as run the app on your computer. 

 Each file type can be found in the apropriate folder (e. g. css files in css folder)
